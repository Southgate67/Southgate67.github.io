The common basilisk can be distinguished from similar species within its range by its large size and the high fin-like crest along its back. 
Most common basilisks are brown and cream in colour. Males also have high crests on the head and tail. 
Both sexes are brown to olive, and have a white, cream, or yellow stripe on the upper lip and a second stripe along either side of the body;
these stripes have higher contrast in juveniles and fade as the lizards age.</p>

Hatchlings weigh a mere 2 <abbr aria-label="grams">g</abbr>(0.071 oz) and are 38 to 43 <abbr aria-label="milimeters">mm</abbr>(1.5 to 1.7 in) long. Adults can grow to a total length (including tail) of 76 cm (2.5 feet). 
Females are generally 135 to 194 <abbr aria-label="grams">g</abbr>(4.8 to 6.8 oz), and weigh half as much as males. 
The tail comprises 70 to 75% of the total length: for example, a 70 <abbr aria-label="centimeters"c>m</abbr> long (27.5-inch-long) common basilisk would have a 50 <abbr aria-label="centimeters">cm</abbr> long (19.5-inch-long) tail. 
The common basilisk has a large mouth with saw-like teeth on the inner sides of the jaw. While the common basilisk is most known for its ability to run on water, 
it is also an excellent climber and swimmer, and has been known to stay under water for up to half an hour. 
The average lifespan is seven years in captivity; in the wild, it tends to be less because of predators.</p>

When startled, the common basilisk escapes by speeding to the nearest edge of water—and continues sprinting. 
The lizard runs on only its hind legs in an erect position, holding its fore legs to its sides. 
The common basilisk is adroit on water because its feet are large and equipped with flaps of skin along the toes that allow it to catch on tiny air bubbles. 
When moving quickly, the lizard can cross a surface of water before sinking.
On water, it runs an average speed of 24.1 km/h (or 15 mph), which is just a little slower than its speed on land.
Younger basilisks can run 10 to 20 m (33 to 66 ft) on water, while adults cross only a few meters before sinking. 
Adults do not move slowly, but they weigh more and cannot sprint for as long a time. Once a basilisk submerges, 
it continues swimming until it is sufficiently far from its pursuer — if the predator has followed past the bank. 
Although the common basilisk stays close to water to escape terrestrial predators, it swims only when necessary because some other aquatic animals would eat it given the chance.</p>
